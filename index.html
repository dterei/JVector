      <p class="News_Heading">Uploaded to Github 10 Years Later!</>
      <p class="News_Date">Date: 2016-05-13 16:51</p>
      <p>10 years after moving to SVN, I've pulled this code out of Sourceforge and my archives and put it up on Github! Next is to get everything working again...</p>
      <p class="News_Heading">Moved to Subversion (SVN)</p>
      <p class="News_Date">Date: 2006-05-13 16:51</p>
      <p>Today I completed the transistion from CVS to Subversion. I moved to SVN as there were a few things with the current state of the cvs resportroy that were annoying me and I didn't want to have to bother sf.net to fix them up. I also have been using SVN as my personel resportory for awhile now and am really impressed with it. So to checkout the latest version of JVector use SVN and not CVS.
      <p class="News_Heading">JVector 0.20.0 Released</p>
      <p class="News_Date">Date: 2005-10-26 16:51</p>
      <p>This represent some large changes to the internal structure of the program. It has been updated to Java 5.0 (1.5, Tiger) and now requires a Java Virtual Machine of version 5.0 (aka 1.5) or greater. If this is a trouble for you I apoligise, but I do not have the motivation to maintain compatability with Java 1.4.2 or earlier. Most bugs have been fixed, see the complete <a href="./change_log.txt">change log</a> for details. There might be some trouble opening previously saved images form ealier versions, however in most cases you should be able to with no troubles. Please contact me if any troubles occur. The SVG export plugin has been removed as there are currently some trobules with it and I wanted to get this release out the door as Ive been holding it back for a while now due to some small problems, largley fixed. An update should follow soon however with a fixed SVG plugin.</p>
      <p class="News_Heading">JVector 0.19pre1 Released</p>
      <p class="News_Date">Date: 2004-06-16 14:00</p>
      <p>SVG Plugin now included, an about box has been added, and a preferrences page, although its largley empty of actual preferences. A Saving while zoomed bug has also been fixed. Only a very few things to go till JVector 0.2, see the TODO list for more information.</p>
      <p>Also, at long last CVS has been brought up to date</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="News_Heading">JVector 0.18 Released!</p>
      <p class="News_Date">Date: 2004-06-07 22:44</p>
      <p class="default">This version adds plugins!</p>
      <p>Plugins can currently be made and used to provide additional output file formats, a JPG, and PNG pugin have been written by myself, as well as a SVG one, but the SVG has some distribution problems at the moment as it requires the Apache Bantik toolkit. So only the JPG, and PNG are being currently distributed.</p>
      <p>Not long now till JVector 0.2! Just some options, and bug fixes to go.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="News_Heading">JVector 0.15 Released!</p>
      <p class="News_Date">Date: 2004-06-01 10:28</p>
      <p>JVector 0.15 has been released!</p>
      <p>Its now been packaged in a IzPack installer, so is easier to install then ever. Zoom support has been addded, a selection tool, a text tool, a deletion tool, and numerous bug fixes.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="News_Heading">JVector 0.1 Released!</p>
      <p class="News_Date">Date: 2004-05-18 22:29</p>
      <p>Hooray!</p>
      <p>Yes JVector 0.1 has been released, the first release at that. It's better then expected, with basic shapes working, as well as the beautiful colour swatches. A unexpected added bonus is that transparency is also working! Saving support has been added, although only to JVector's native format.</p>
      <p>Expect releases to be more frequent now, but I wanted the first release to be fully functional, hence the longish time.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="News_Heading">Welcome to the JVector Project!</p>
