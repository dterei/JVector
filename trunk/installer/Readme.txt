Thankyou for your interest in JVector.
This file explains some brief general information of JVector, 
and the process needed to build and run JVector.

-------
JVector
-------
JVector is a Vector (wow!) based paint program. It aims to currently
provide fairly simple tools, simliar to MS Paint, but being Vector based.
New and exciting features, such as texturing, are more important then advance
node editing for this project.

JVector is written in, you guessed it, Java! The project is hosted on 
sourceforge.net (http://sourceforge.net/projects/t-bone-paint). This project
is an open source project of course, under the GPL (GNU General Public Licence).
